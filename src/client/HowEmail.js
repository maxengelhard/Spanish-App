            <h1>Give Me A Year And Four Months And You Will Be Fluent In 5,000 Of The Top Words</h1>
            <h4>A scientific method to make you fluent</h4>
            <p>Benefits Of Knowing 5,000 words</p>
            <p>Professor Arguelles, arguably one of the worldâ€™s foremost experts on language learning and who, 
                himself, is fluent in eleven languages and has studied 58 at some point or another, has addressed 
                this in a fascinating thread on my favorite language-learning forum, HTLAL, concerning how many words 
                you need to learn (he is directly addressing the above study in this quote) and does a superb job of 
                boiling this down for us language-learners in practical terms that are useful to us:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Learning the first 1000 most frequently used words in the entire language will allow you to understand 76.0% of all non-fiction writing, 79.6% of all fiction writing, and an astounding 87.8% of all oral speech.</li>
            <li>Learning the top 2000 most frequently used words will get you to 84% for non-fiction, 86.1% for fiction, and 92.7% for oral speech.</li>
            <li>And learning the top 3000 most frequently used words will get you to 88.2% for non-fiction, 89.6% for fiction, and 94.0% for oral speech.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best way to learn is to practice. And practice repeadilty. This is what this email service finally accomplishes</p>
            <p>What you'll be getting: daily fun practice. Access to the top 5,000 frequent words. Repeated practice. Constant improvement.</p>
