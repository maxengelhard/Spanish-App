            <h1>Give Me A Year And Four Months And You Will Be Fluent In 5,000 Of The Top Words</h1>
            <h4>A scientific method to make you fluent</h4>
            <p>Benefits Of Knowing 5,000 words</p>
            <p>Professor Arguelles, arguably one of the worldâ€™s foremost experts on language learning and who, 
                himself, is fluent in eleven languages and has studied 58 at some point or another, has addressed 
                this in a fascinating thread on my favorite language-learning forum, HTLAL, concerning how many words 
                you need to learn (he is directly addressing the above study in this quote) and does a superb job of 
                boiling this down for us language-learners in practical terms that are useful to us:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Learning the first 1000 most frequently used words in the entire language will allow you to understand 76.0% of all non-fiction writing, 79.6% of all fiction writing, and an astounding 87.8% of all oral speech.</li>
            <li>Learning the top 2000 most frequently used words will get you to 84% for non-fiction, 86.1% for fiction, and 92.7% for oral speech.</li>
            <li>And learning the top 3000 most frequently used words will get you to 88.2% for non-fiction, 89.6% for fiction, and 94.0% for oral speech.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why use our email list?</p>
            <p>You can easily go out and buy a dictionary (they even have the top 6000 words in a book)... it cost $35.35</p>
            <p>Now here is an example email of ours. Take it for a spin</p>
            <p>In the beggining you will get a list of new words. Starting with the most frequent words in Spanish and each day progressivley getting less and less frequent.</p>
            <p>However, what's interesting about our system is that we will continually have you practiing all previous words the next day.</p>
            <p>Becuase these are based off of frequency all of our sentences will have a higher probablity that the words you learned on your first day will be used on the 30th day as well</p>
            <p>Take a look at how many worlds you would know after each day would</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Then put in the clicker and how it would change</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------</p>
            <p>The best way to learn is to practice. And practice repeadilty. This is what this email service finally accomplishes</p>
            <p>What you'll be getting: daily fun practice. Access to the top 5,000 frequent words. Repeated practice. Constant improvement.</p>
